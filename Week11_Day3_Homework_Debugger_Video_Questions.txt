What is the purpose of a breakpoint?
When we debug the application it will run as normal until it hits the breakpoint. When it reaches the breakpoint it will pause the application and launch the debugger console.

Does the line of code on a breakpoint run when you start debugging?
No. The application is paused before the line of code with the breakpoint.

How do we debug the next line of code?
Using the options available in the debugger, you can 'Stepover' to run the next line of code and then pause.

What does the step into command do?
It steps into the next function to be run and pause. So the debugger screen moves to the class and shows you the next function.
